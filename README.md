# mini-world | [中文](READE_zh.md)

I want to build a mini world as a mapping of the real world.

## Original intention

I want to build a mini-world as a mapping of the real world.

A world contains only the elements mapping of the real world we care, not all of them.

Maybe everybody who has his characteristic is the soul of the mini-world, and everybody's behavior to express who he is.
yes, I want to build real person.

## Core Target

One: drawing mini-world's soul using "JAVA", cause of it's abstract ability.

Two: using "javascript" to granting mini-world body and blood.

Three: combine media to showing mini-world itself well.

## Scheduling

Mini-world maybe building on all of my life date-times, I'm not in a hurry.
