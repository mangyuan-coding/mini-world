# Design for mini-world

## Original intention

I want to build a mini-world as a mapping of the real world.

A world contains only the elements mapping of the real world we care, not all of them.

Maybe everybody who has his characteristic is the soul of the mini-world, and everybody's behavior to express who he is.
yes, I want to build real person.

## Core Target

One: drawing mini-world's soul using "JAVA", cause of it's abstract ability.

Two: using "javascript" to granting mini-world body and blood.

Three: combine media to showing mini-world itself well.

## Scheduling

Mini-world maybe building on all of my life times, I'm not in a hurry.

### Target One: "Objective environment"

The basic elements of the world. 

I'll revisit knowledge of physical and chemical. All the elements of the real world, the mini-world should contain. It's also has some abstract concepts, like gravity.

#### chemical element: (TODO)

#### substance: (TODO)

#### physical concept: (TODO)

#### earth: (TODO)

#### universe: (TODO)
