# Relativity

## Spacetime

A spacetime is a **_manifold_** of **_events_** that is endowed with a **_metric_**.

### Manifold

A set of **_points_** with well-understood **_connectedness_** properties.

A manifold is essentially just a set or a collection of points with well understood connectedness properties.

### Event

This is **_when_** and **_where_** **_something_** happens.

Could be anything. Form our point of view, the event essentially is going to be the fundamental notion 
of a coordinate in spacetime.

**_Coordinates_** are actually sort of **_labels_** that we attach to events.

But the event itself exists independent of these labels.

### Metric

A notion of distance between events in the manifold.

## Clocks And Measuring rods

Lattice of **_clocks_** and **_measuring rods_** that allows us to **_label_**-'assign' coordinates to - **_spacetime events_**.

A lattice of clocks and measuring rods that allows us to label, in other words, to assign coordinates any event that
happens in spacetime.

### Properties

    (i)   Lattice moves freely through spacetime. --- no forces act on it, does not rotate. 
    (ii)  Measuring rods are orthogonal to each other. --- tick marks are uniformly spaced.
    (iii) Clocks tick uniformly.
    (iv)  Clocks synchronized using "Einstein synchronization procedure". --- the speed of light is the same to all observers.
