## Pre-solution and Contradiction

If I build the world from micro, there are orders of magnitude of electrons and protons, but "jvm" can't hold on.

## Suppose "Relativity"

”Observer“

"micro-world", maybe only the God can really know it.

Cause of my mini-world's soul is human, they can't know every thing. so, they only know they received message using their eyes and ears.

if using some tools, like microscope or optical microscope , they can see a lot of the real world.

Another question is, even if the world is constructed from a human perspective, China is very big, the earth is very big, and the universe is also very big. 
How can this be done? It is still people-oriented and built with the environment that people see.
When a person moves, load the environment he is in into the jvm, and other things that exist in themselves, as "Schrodinger's cat", 
implement a certain random algorithm to describe the trajectory of these things.
Only the moment when a person sees it is the true state of things.

so, every person is an observer.
